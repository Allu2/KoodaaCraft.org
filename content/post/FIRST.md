Today marks the day we are burying the old home page and going forward with the new!

Some of you may have noticed that the old home page was kind of.. dead.. and you'd be right!

Infact the home page used to be built on top of blogging software Ghost, but as it was rarely updated
eventually we moved using a static copy of the home page instead. 

This is like replacing your friend with a 1:1 sized
cardboard copy of him, and not being able to tell the difference.

While such site worked for as long as we don't want to post any updates, its time has come to an end
and a new era where we can once more, update our home page.. has arrived!
