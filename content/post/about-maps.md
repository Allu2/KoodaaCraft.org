Maps... The explorers treasure trove. View to faraway places that tell a story of what can be found.
Originally I (Allyoutoo) was thinking that maybe we don't need maps.
Minecraft has a great item of the same name which can be used to paint a picture of what you've seen on your travels. However I do regonize the requests and use-cases for an Online, pre explored map
<!--more-->

This is why, as most observant members of our community may have noticed.
I have given up to the requests and generated a map for Koodaa's latest world.

To get full sized image you can right click and open the image in a new tab, or save it locally :)

I do understand that this map is far cry from the likes of Dynmap and Mapcrafter.
This partly cause I'm lazy, and partly cause I think this is enough.
Its very rough map, basically just showing biome limits with no actual features.
Notice how the rivers in the map are continuous, yeah thats not how reality looks like.
But I like it, it reveals enough to wonder, and maybe to plan a trip to see, what is it really like in there..
