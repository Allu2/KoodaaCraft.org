Oh yeah didn't mention it before but we have dynmap...

# Do we really have Dynmap? 🤔

Readers who have read this site before may remember another map related post.
In there I scratched a bit of the surface when it comes to my thoughts on maps in Minecraft and how more fancy mapping tools like Dynmap or Mapcrafter might be taking away from the exploration aspect in the game.

Given this history it might be unexpected to see such a change in direction...

But yes 👍 We have had dynmap for a while now more or less public and you can find it here: [Koodaacraft Dynmap](http://tomorrow.koodaacraft.org:8123/#)

# What changed? 🤷‍♂️

Nothing really, just that we got bit more storage space with the new server (should write a post about that too 😅) and this gave us some more leeway to render the map 🤔

So feel free to check out the map 👍
