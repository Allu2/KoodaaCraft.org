## Site maintenance at its best 🗞️ 

So we've gone and updated our site theme.
This was done as it seem the previous theme wasn't maintained and we wanted to move on with our `hugo` setup.
The endgame of course is to keep our site updateable and hopefully increase our update speed from years
to at least monthly..or quartelry updates.🤔 

In this change we've also added the `About` page which will hopefully be updated later on to contain some more
specific information about the server, its history and its staff. Hopefully turning into something welcoming that may yet lure more players to our little community.🚀 

Things are still taking shape but expect more work on this over coming weeks.

Oh and we updated the banner image as well, its a picture from Allyoutoo's home.👍
