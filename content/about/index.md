## About KoodaaCraft
**_KoodaaCraft_** is a small community that runs a Minecraft server. We've been at this for over a decade with changing number of members joining when ever
we have time to.

We mainly hang around in the community discord. As there is a relay from the Minecraft to Discord
so even if the server seems empty you may reach out in the chat.

Note though that we're a small community with various timezones so it may take time before
any message is replied to.
