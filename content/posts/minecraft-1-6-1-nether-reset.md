### Other news: Website back in operation

There was a lack of updates for a while due to source control and deployment drifting apart, this has now been fixed enabling more upgrades in near future.

## Known issues

* Gravy is still broken
* SoulShards is DISABLED, due to performance issues we're having SoulShards disabled until those are fixed in future version.
  * DO NOT break your existing spawners, as they ought to start working again once the plugin gets added back.
