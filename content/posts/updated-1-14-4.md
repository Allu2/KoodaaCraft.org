Announicing server update for 1\.14\.4! Well the title says it all but feel free to read further
where we go through the brief history of how I tend to learn of this updates and what
follows..

So as I'm writing this post, the server is actually waiting for a restart, which will then bring up to the latest version of Minecraft.
As often is, news of this release come to me from our lovely community as Lutyx noticed the update and Dragon pinged me and Hannah about it :)

Shortly after I instructed Dragon to check https://hub.spigotmc.org/versions/1.14.4.json
and tell me once the link doesn't return 404. That file describes how to build spigot version 1.14.4 for spigot's Buildtool
in practise, once it works I can build new spigot version for the server, and thus update to 1.14.4

Then this morning we got the message :)

and I started building the new server staight away, and here we are :)
