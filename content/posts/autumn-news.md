It's been a while since the web site was updated...
<!--more-->


# Current version 📜

Let's start by stating that we're currently running 1.19.2, actually we've been running
that for months at this point! 😅 (At time of writing this the main page proudly proclaims we're in the 1.18's!)

# Future plans and stuff 🚀

We're increasing storage available to us, which will directly translate into more map area to explore later on!

Beyond that for now we're looking into keeping plugins up-to-date though this is always a work in progress.

If there is features or updates missing you'd like to see, do reach out to the staff in our Discord 👍


Till next time 👋
