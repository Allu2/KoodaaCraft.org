This was done as it seem the previous theme wasn&amp;rsquo;t maintained and we wanted to move on with our hugo setup. The endgame of course is to keep our site updateable and hopefully increase our update speed from years to at least monthly..or quartelry updates.🤔
In this change we&amp;rsquo;ve also added the About page which will hopefully be updated later on to contain some more specific information about the server, its history and its staff.</description></item></channel></rss>
